There are basically three steps involved:
  1. convert CSV dataset file to sequence file so that Mahout can be applied
  2. train sequence file with Naive Bayes provided by Mahout libraries
  3. test to see the accuracy result
  
  

training results:
  features: 39
  labels: 3300
 
testing results: 
 correctly classfied instances: 60592
  total classfied instances: 311028
  correct ratio: 0.1948
