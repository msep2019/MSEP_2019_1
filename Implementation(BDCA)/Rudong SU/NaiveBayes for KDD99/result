There are basically three steps involved:
  1. convert CSV dataset file to sequence file so that Mahout can be applied
  2. train sequence file with Naive Bayes provided by Mahout libraries
  3. test to see the accuracy result
  
  

results:
  correct classifies: 60592
  total sample count: 311028
  correct ratio: 0.1948
