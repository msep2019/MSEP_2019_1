terminate node worker1:

 use command: dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/file bs=1G count=10 to fullfill the RAM of this node thus the node is killed.
 
 Issue encountered:
    1. bs = 30G count = 10
      the cluster has no response : assigned too much memory to creat each time
      
    2. bs = 1M count = 1
        processed but not useful because too small
        
    3. bs = 1G count = 1
        the cluster has no response
