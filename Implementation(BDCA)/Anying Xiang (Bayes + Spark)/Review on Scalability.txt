Literature Review

Paper Citation: Yeonhee Lee and Youngseok Lee. 2012. Toward scalable internet traffic measurement and analysis with Hadoop. SIGCOMM Comput. Commun. Rev. 43, 1 (January 2012), 5-13.

Scalability:
more nodes (5 -> 30) -> better performance: 
    -> Job completion time (71 minutes -> 11 minutes)
    -> Throughput (1.9 Gbps -> 12.8 Gbps)
Comparison: performance of TCP analysis < IP & HTTP analysis in terms of CPU, storage, and network resources

Steps for examining how input file size has impact on performance:
    Execute IP, TCP, and HTTP analysis jobs with various file sizes in the same Big Data platform environment -> increased / decreased throughput
