Explore Cross Validation

1. Cross Validation is used to improve the accuracy of Machine Learning Models.
2. Cross Validation only uses training data set, because in reality, test data set is unknown, 
but it regards a part of the training data set as test data set to be tested by itself before finishing training the model, 
which may present the problems in the current model, 
and as a result, developer can work out the wrong parameters in the model and improves performance.
3. K-fold Cross Validation: Divide the training set into K parts, and then it can iteratively have K different pairs of training and testing data sets.
