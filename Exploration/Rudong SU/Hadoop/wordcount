Some key steps of running wordcount program in Hadoop:
  1. Setting up "Virtual Box" virtual environment and import Cloudera VM file.
  2. Creating program folders on Eclipse and coding "WordCount" program on Eclipse: 
  3. Downloading "Complete Works of William Shakespeare" datasets by using cURL command (also remove the BOM)
  4. Configuring, running and exporting the program.
  5. Running WordCount job on command and finally viewing the job logs.


Issues encounterd:
1. Errors in coding:
    difference in version of Hadoop 1.0 and 2.0 between "import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Mapper" and "import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Mapper" caused errors
2. Warnings after coding
   "util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform" after execution the program on Eclipse
3. Failure in loading "pg100" files: 
    after entering "hadoop fs -put workspace/WordCount/pg100.txt". terminal displays error "No such file or directory",
    however, there is a txt file named "pg100" under WordCount directory.
