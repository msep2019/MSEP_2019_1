In order to research the scalability and reliability of a Big Data Cyber Security Analytics (BDCA) System, 
We will use different big data frameworks. Hadoop is one of our experimental subjects.

As a reference, we use the Hadoop Tutorial (CS246: Mining Massive Data Sets) from Stanford University to set up and configure our experimental environment. 

Download and install VirtualBox on your machine: http://virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
Download the Cloudera Quickstart VM at https://downloads.cloudera.com/demo_vm/virtualbox/cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.13.0-0-virtualbox.zip

Install the Cloudera Quickstart VM on VirtualBox

Instead of the Virtual Box, I am trying to set up the Cloudera Quickstart VM on different virtual machines like VMware Fusion.

Hadoop can be run in three modesï¼š
    1. Standalone (or local) mode
    2. Pseudo-distributed mode
    3. Fully-distributed mode
    
Our tests will be based on these three modes.
