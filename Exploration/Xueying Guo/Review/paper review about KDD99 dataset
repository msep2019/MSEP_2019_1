This dataset was processed by using about 5 million network connections at DARPA.
Each network record has 41 features and it is also labled as either normal or attack type.
There are total 22 types of attack are mentioned in this dataset, and these attacks have been clasified into 4 groups:
1) Denial of Service ( DoS),
