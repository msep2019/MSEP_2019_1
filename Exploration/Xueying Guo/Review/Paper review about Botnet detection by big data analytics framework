Topic: Big Data Analytics framework for Peer-to-Peer Botnet detection using Random Forests

Summary:
This paper purposes quasi-real-time system for intrusion detection based on open source tools like Hadoop, Hive and Mahout. 

Some definitions:
Botnet: a network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge, e.g., to send spam messages.

Mahout: machine learning library built on top of Hadoop. The distributed implementation of Mahout plays a significant role in big data analysis. 
Mahout’s native library of random forest’s implementation is used for training and classification purpose. 

Random forest: it is appropriate to process high-dimensional data and ignores irrelevant descriptors.
