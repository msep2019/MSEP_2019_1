We are going to assign weights to get utility function. 
will use regression to assign weight.
by giving a set of experiment data, to get the utility.

I will try to use ‘Ridge Regression’ for utlity function


weights generated:

𝜔_𝑐𝑝𝑢	0.27
𝜔_𝑚𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑦	0.24
𝜔_𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑘𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡	0.21
𝜔_𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑣	0.25
𝜔_𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑	0.03

results: close #126
Fuzzy Rules: close #127
