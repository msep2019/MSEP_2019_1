S1. Download Gparted and open.

S2. find out the the unallocated filesystem (new space assigned to virtual machine) is right next to the filesystem that is required to enlarge. 
* if the new filesystem is not next to the filesystem required to enlarge, it is not possible to add size.

S3. some filesystem may be locked, there are 2 possibilities:
  1) this is a swap filesystem, to solve this, can right click this system and choose 'swapoff'.
  2) this is a mounted filesystem, to solve this, can right click this system and choose 'unmount'.
then the filesystem can be unlocked.
* for S3.2, if a mounted filesystem cannot be unmount because of 'busy', then it is need to use USB as a start up disk to launch GParted, so that all filesystems are shown as an 'unmounted' status.

S4. To use a USB as a start up disk, need to execute below commands to download Tuxboot.
  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:thomas.tsai/ubuntu-tuxboot
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install tuxboot
  tuxboot
  
S5. after launch tuxboot, plug in a USB to virtual machine and download the ios file into the USB. and reboot virtual machine.

S6. Enter the BIOS boot menu and choose USB drive as the startup target.
* S6 is the step adviced from Tuxboot official website, but when I enter BIOS boot manu, I found I do not have permission to change the startup device since I is a 'user mode'. so I failed to change this in BIOS manual though I tried many different ways.
* at the end, I found I can choose the startup Disk in VMWare Fusion by steps:
  VMWare Library -> setting -> Startup Disk -> CD/DVD

S7. When launching by other disks, in the prompt up page, choose 'Try ubuntu without installing' and launch GParted here. finding all filesystems are unmounted (no key icons displyed).

S8. right click the filesystem needed to enlarge and click 'apply'.

S9. Apply this setting to the disks we need to use by setting.
  Manu -> Edit -> Apply all Operations -> Apply

S10. restart virtual machine by the original disk, then the filesystem is already extended.
