This is a folder to restore scripts for collecting and calculating statistic from clusters.

***** meaning for each script ******

----- Run in master node ----
sc1. run.sh ~~ for running BDCA system with default properties and all customized properties automatically.
sc2. run_without_properties.sh  ~~ for running BDCA system with default properties only.
sc3. run_with_properties.sh ~~ for running BDCA system with customized properties.

sc4. cluster.sh ~~ for collecting utilizations during the BDCA system is running, run before 'run.sh'
sc5. kill_cluster.sh ~~ for stopping collecting utilizations after 'run.sh' is finished.

----- Run in worker nodes ----
sc4. cluster.sh ~~ for collecting utilizations during the BDCA system is running, run before 'run.sh'
sc5. kill_cluster.sh ~~ for stopping collecting utilizations after 'run.sh' is finished.


----- Run in local ----
sc6. get_utilization.sh  ~~ for collecting all statistic collected from clusters seperately and calculate average for each node during the training period.
sc7. get_utilization_all.sh  ~~ for calculating average statistic for all worker nodes during the training period.
sc8. cleanup.sh  ~~ for cleaning up all temperary files before next batch running.

***** USAGE ******

sc1. ./run.sh 
sc2. ./run_without_properties.sh <algorithm> <dataset> 
 e.g. nohup ./run_without_properties.sh RF CIDD &
sc3. ./run_with_properties.sh <algorithm> <dataset> <name_of_configuration> <value_of_setting>
 e.g. nohup ./run_with_properties.sh RF CIDD mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress true &
sc4. ./cluster.sh <number of cluster>
 e.g. nohup ./cluster.sh 1 &
sc5. ./kill_cluster.sh <number of cluster>
 e.g. nohup ./kill_cluster.sh 1 &
sc6. ./get_utilization.sh 
sc7. ./get_utilization_all.sh 
sc8. ./cleanup.sh

***** Batch ******
S1. Run script to collect statistics from master and all worker nodes. [run in master node and worker nodes]
-> nohup ./cluster.sh 1 &

S2. Check parameter files to ensure the required Hadoop properties, datasets and machine learning algorithms can be run by the BDCA system.
-> actual_change.param
-> all_conf.param
-> algorithm.param
-> package_name.param

S3. Run BDCA system by script. [run in master node only]
->  nohup ./run.sh &

S4. Check logs and make sure S3 is completed.

S5. Run script to stop collecting statistics from master and all worker nodes. [run in master node and worker nodes]
-> nohup ./kill_cluster.sh 1 &

S6. Check parameter files to ensure all statistics got by required datasets and ML algorithms can be calculated.
-> cal_algorithm.param

S7. Run script to collecting statistics from cluster and calculating utilization. [run in local]
-> nohup ./get_utilization.sh &

S8. Run script to calculating average utilization for all worker nodes. [run in local]
-> nohup ./get_utilization_all.sh &

S9. Run script to clean up temperary files produced during the batch running.
-> nohup ./cleanup.sh &

S10. check result files.
