// this is a procedure analysis when implementing the Naive Bayes algorithm

The procedures for Naive Bayes are as below

For training:
upload csv files to HDFS -> decompress training files -> generating sequence file -> start training (map reduce) -> save model
For testing:
upload test files to HDFS -> transfer csv file to sequence file -> start predict by saved model -> output -> calculate accuracy

Ovservation:
a long time before submitting a map reduce job for training.
