The procedure of random forest is as below:

Generating descriptor file by descriptor -> specify number of trees / seed -> Do training -> save model -> do testing -> calculate accuracy



Observation:
when doing the testing (map reduce), not all datanodes are fully used. I found this is because the number of split mappers is just 1, I believe this can be changed to make all data nodes to be fully used.
so when doing the testing by map reduce method, only 1 worker node is used.

for testing by sequential method, only master node is used and all worker nodes are free.
