Sqoop 
Sqoop extracts useful information from Hadoop and passes to the outside data stores. Sqoop can be used for transfering data from Hadoop(Hive) and traditional database (like MySQL, Oracle).
Sqoop can load the data from HDFS to database and from databases to HDFS.
Also, Sqoop can split datasets and create different Hadoop tasks for each block.
