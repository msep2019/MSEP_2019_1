five steps to generate fuzzy rules:

1. dividing the input and output spaces into fuzzy regions (2N+1)
2. generate fuzzy rules from the given data pairs ('and' or 'or')
3. assign a certain degree of each rule to to resolving possible conficts
4. creating a combined fuzzy rule based on step 3
5. a mapping from input to output
