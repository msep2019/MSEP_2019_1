.pcap Format tooks time to be loaded and processed.
training set: 9388270 records
testing set: 5114514 records

Since the data volume is too large, so I seperate them to small files (i.e. 4-5 mb per files, 10000 records per file) to run, over this size, the program will hang on and without response. 
and each file took around 4 mins.

it can be extracted to csv directly by wireshark, however, we need to extract more features so have to use scapy.
