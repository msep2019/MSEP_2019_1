This is steps to install kaggle and download these datasets.

S1. use command to install kaggle. 
pip install kaggle
* kaggle supports python3 only. In my computer, python 2.7 and 3.7 exists, so I use 'pip3 install kaggle' instead.

S2. config the ./bash file 

S3. Sign up to Kaggle and download the kaggle.json, put it on %KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR%\kaggle.json

S4. use command to change the permission of kaggle.json
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

S5. agree the terms and condition of the competition in kaggle. 
* otherwise, it will show '403 - Forbidden' when downloading.
