In paper 'Babar, M. , Arif, F. , Jan, M. A. , Tan, Z. , & Khan, F. . (2019). Urban data management system: towards big data analytics for internet of things based smart urban environment using customized hadoop. Future Generation Computer Systems.', the authors discuss a data management system with customised Hadoop. 

The authors discuss how to customise Hadoop for efficient processing. 
In terms of data loading, they load the data in a parallel way and reduce the data ingestion time.
They modify configurations about replicas (3 to 2) and block size (from 128MB to 256MB) for lower network overhead. 
They also use the Apache Sqoop tool which supports parallel data loading. 
They also use Yarn.

The authors calculate throughput to check processing speed and efficiency, and compare their system with classical MR. 
They find that their system has higher efficiency.
