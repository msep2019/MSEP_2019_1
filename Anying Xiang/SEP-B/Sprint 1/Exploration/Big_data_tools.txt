1. Trident [1]
    Trident is a high-level abstraction and works on top of Storm. 
    Trident has joins, aggregations, grouping, functions, and filters for batch processing, and processes the stream as small batches of tuples.
    Trident works well with database due to stateful and incremental processing.
    Trident persists state, so when there is the need for retries, there wonâ€™t be multiple updates to the database.
    For updates to the database for the batch of processing, Trident do less read or write requests, and thus improve the performance.
    Trident has optimised aggregators and does partial aggregations to improve efficiency.

2. Storm-yarn [2]
    Storm cluster can be deployed on Hadoop Yarn with Storm-yarn.
    It gets the advantages brought by Yarn.

3. Kafka [3], storm-kafka-client [4]
    Kafka is a distributed streaming platform.
    For integration with queueing system, Storm can integrate with Kafka for stream processing.
    kafka-client library enables Spouts and Bolts to communicate with Kafka.

4. Streamparse [5]
    Streamparse enables people to run Python code on Storm.
    Python is popular in machine learning. We can try Python machine learning libraries to check whether the response time can be improved.

5. Apache HDFS Integration [6]
    With the components, Storm can use HDFS.
    Storm data can be written to HDFS sequence files with SequenceFileBolt class.
    HDFS spout enable people to feed data into Storm from HDFS.

6. Storm MongoDB Integration [7]
    We can try to use MongoDB with Storm, such as inserting, updating and looking up.
    Mongo trident MapState is supported.
    This can be compared with HDFS or other database integration options to check whether the response time can be improved.

7. Yahoo Streaming Benchmarks [8]
    The benchmark can be used to evaluate the advantages and limitations of particular stream processing platforms, such as Storm.
    In the paper [9], the authors have evaluated and compared Storm, Flink and Spark.

8. Kryo serialization [10]
    It is a binary object graph serialization framework for faster serialization of objects. 
    We can try to replace Java serialization.

9. Sqoop [11]
    Sqoop is used for transferring bulk data efficiently.
    In [12], the authors use Sqoop for efficient parallel data loading.

10. GridGain [13]
    GridGain is an in-memory computing platform, and it can accelerate HDFS and Map-Reduce for data intensive applications.
