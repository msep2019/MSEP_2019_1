In the paper 'Performance evaluation of cloud-based log file analysis with Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark' by Ilias Mavridis and Helen Karatza in 2017, they use the following metrics to evalute the performance besides response time:
1. CPU: percentage of CPU utilization
2. Memory: kiloBytes of memory
3. Hard disk: reads (rtps) and writes (wtps) requests
4. Network: kiloBytes received (rxkB) and transmitted (txkB)
5. power consumption (prediction): a power consumption model based on the CPU, memory, disk and network statistics to predict the power consumption

In the paper 'G. Velkoski, M. Simjanoska, S. Ristov and M. Gusev, "CPU utilization in a multitenant cloud," Eurocon 2013, Zagreb, 2013, pp. 242-249.', it focuses on the CPU utilization in the cloud.

In the paper 'B. G. Batista, J. C. Estrella, M. J. Santana, R. H. C. Santana and S. Reiff-Marganiec, "Performance Evaluation in a Cloud with the Provisioning of Different Resources Configurations," 2014 IEEE World Congress on Services, Anchorage, AK, 2014, pp. 309-316.', the authors use the metric of requests number (Quantity of served requests per VM) and execution time.

In the paper 'T. C. Chieu, A. Mohindra and A. A. Karve, "Scalability and Performance of Web Applications in a Compute Cloud," 2011 IEEE 8th International Conference on e-Business Engineering, Beijing, 2011, pp. 317-323.', the authors mention indicators like active connections number, requests number per second, response times per request for web applications.

In the paper 'L. Gu and H. Li, "Memory or Time: Performance Evaluation for Iterative Operation on Hadoop and Spark," 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications & 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing, Zhangjiajie, 2013, pp. 721-727.', the authors use execution time and memory usage per second.
