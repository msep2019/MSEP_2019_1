TOOL-1:
Apache Ignite
According to [1]:
1. Apache Ignite: distributed memory-centric database and caching platform
2. The advantages of Ignite:
  in-memory performance at scale;
  improve the performance of DataFrame and SQL;
  share data among jobs.
3. Ignite Shared RDDs: distributed Ignite table

According to [2]:
1. IgniteContext instance
2. IgniteRDD: read and write to Ignite
3. Ignite DataFrame

Steps:
add dependency to sbt (modify build.sbt)
add external lib:
ignite-core, ignite-spark, ignite-spring, ignite-indexing, h2-1.4.195.jar
spring-beans, spring-core, spring-context, spring-expression, javax-api

start ignite:
bin/ignite.sh

Deploy on Yarn:

[2] https://apacheignite-fs.readme.io/docs

However, it is quite complicated to use Ignite in BDCA, I spent more than 6 hours on it (explore, set up environment and try), but it keeps giving me errors (please check https://github.com/msep2019/MSEP_2019_1/blob/master/Anying%20Xiang/SEP-B/Sprint%202/Ignite.png). So I have to turn to other tools.

Conclusion: the jar is ready, need further experiments on cloud
