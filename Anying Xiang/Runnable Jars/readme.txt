The Runnable Jars folder contains four Jar files (i.e., BDCA systems). Two Jar files can use KDD99, DARPA, CIDDS and CICIDS2017 with Naïve Bayes and Random Forest respectively on Spark (i.e., BDCA_Spark_NaiveBayes.jar and BDCA_Spark_RandomForest.jar). Two Jar files can use KDD99 and CIDDS respectively with Naïve Bayes on Hadoop (i.e., BDCA_Hadoop_KDD99.jar and BDCA_Hadoop_CIDDS.jar).
