The Code folder consists of Adaptation Approach, Automated Scripts and BDCA Systems. 

For BDCA Systems, I have implemented one with Naïve Bayes on Spark (i.e., NaiveBayesSpark.scala), one with Random Forest on Spark (i.e., RandomForestSpark.scala), and one with Naïve Bayes on Hadoop (i.e., HadoopNB.java). 

For Automated Scripts, I have written some Shell Scripts (e.g., TestHadoopKDD.sh, TestRFMainCIDDS.sh) to automate some processes in experiments, where I need to run BDCA systems repetitively.

For Adaptation Approach, I have implemented the parameter-driven adaptation approach presented in the research report with Shell Script (i.e., AdaptionBDCA.sh).
