Y. Du, J. Liu, F. Liu and L. Chen, "A Real-Time Anomalies Detection System Based on Streaming Technology," 2014 Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics, Hangzhou, 2014, pp. 275-279.

Summary:
The authors propose a anomalies detection system based on Apache Storm in the context of big data and cyber security.
They use flow data as their data set.
They choose Storm over MapReduce, because they think that MapReduce cannot realize real-time big data processing progress well.
Their system includes data collection as well as data processing.
There are four modules in their data processing, which are Monitor, TopN, Storage and Query Model.
TopN model involves Suspects, compared with Storage model, which involves real anomalies.
In their anomalies detection, they use 'k-NN', and in their TopN model, they use 'Frequent algorithm', which is about N counter values.
They evaluate their accurateness, performance and scalability.
In the case of scalability evaluation, they change cluster nodes numbers so that they can experiment on the capacity.

Strength:
This paper works on defecting anomalies and locating the source in cyber and big data context.
It also talks about how the authors evaluate their system, and the evaluation also includes scalability.
It's very worth reading.
