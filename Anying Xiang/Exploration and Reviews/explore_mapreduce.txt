Understanding about Map Reduce

1. Map Reduce is for calculation of a huge amount of data, especially through a distributed computing way.

2. Map Reduce includes two steps:
    1) Map: 
        a) As what it is called, the operation is about mapping, for example, it filtes data.
        b) Input data is split, and multiple map tasks work in a parallel way.
        c) Map takes key-values as its input data, and the processed key-values will be written to the disk, and then be processed by a particular Reduce worker (assigned by 'master' compared to 'worker').
        d) Mapper class to be extended.
    2) Reduce: 
        a) It summarizes the output data of Map tasks (as its input data) and produces desired results.
        b) Reduce will sort the input data in the first place, and then call reduce function for every unique key.
        c) Each Reduce corresponds to a output file (e.g.: part-00000, part-00001, ...).
        d) Reducer class to be extended.

3. 'master' is responsible for assigning map or reduce to various workers.

4. Data is processed as key-values.

5. Implementation of Writable is for serializing the objects.
