The Exploration and Reviews folder consists of Exploration and Reviews.

For Exploration, I have explored Hadoop, Spark, MapReduce, Mahout, SparkML, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Cross Validation. I also tried to run some examples and did some practices in this phase.

For Reviews, I have reviewed papers about Big Data and Security, BDCA, KDD99 and Scalability.
