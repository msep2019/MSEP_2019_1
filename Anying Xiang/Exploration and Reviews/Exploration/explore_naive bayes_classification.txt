Understanding about Naive Bayes Classification

1. Naive Bayes assumes that different features are independent from each other, so that the probability can be calculated more easily by multiplicative multiplication.
2. Bayes formula is the foundation (prior probability, conditional probability and posterior probability are involved).
3. When it comes to the classification, the following value is decisive:
    val = P(X = x | Y = yk) * P(Y = yk)
    The 'val' decides pro = P(Y = yk | X = x), where k means different classes. 
    Different probabilities ('pro') among various classes will be compared to determine the particular classification (larger 'pro').
